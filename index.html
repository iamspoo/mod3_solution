      "Looking back on a childhood filled with events and memories, I find it rather difficult to pick one that leaves me with the fabled "warm and fuzzy feelings." 
	  As the daughter of an Air Force major, I had the pleasure of traveling across America in many moving trips. I have visited the monstrous trees of the Sequoia 
	  National Forest, stood on the edge of the Grand Canyon and have jumped on the beds at Caesar's Palace in Lake Tahoe."<br>
    "The day I picked my dog up from the pound was one of the happiest days of both of our lives. I had gone to the pound just a week earlier with the idea that 
	I would just "look" at a puppy. Of course, you can no more just look at those squiggling little faces so filled with hope and joy than you can stop the sun 
	from setting in the evening. I knew within minutes of walking in the door that I would get a puppy… but it wasn't until I saw him that I knew I had found my puppy."<br>
    "Looking for houses was supposed to be a fun and exciting process. Unfortunately, none of the ones that we saw seemed to match the specifications that we had established. 
	They were too small, too impersonal, too close to the neighbors. After days of finding nothing even close, we began to wonder: was there really a perfect house out there for us?"
<br>
The following is an example of a famous narrative written by John Updike, Hub Fans Bid Kid Adieu.<br>
"The afternoon grew so glowering that in the sixth inning the arc lights were turned on--always a wan sight in the daytime, like the burning headlights of a funeral procession. 
Aided by the gloom, Fisher was slicing through the Sox rookies, and Williams did not come to bat in the seventh. He was second up in the eighth. 
This was almost certainly his last time to come to the plate in Fenway Park, and instead of merely cheering, as we had at his three previous appearances, 
we stood, all of us, and applauded."

Good descriptive writing creates an impression in the reader's mind of an event, a place, a person, or a thing. 
The writing will be such that it will set a mood or describe something in such detail that if the reader saw it, they would recognize it.<br>
To be good, descriptive writing has to be concrete, evocative and plausible.
<br>
To be concrete, descriptive writing has to offer specifics the reader can envision. Rather than "Her eyes were the color of blue rocks" 
(Light blue? Dark blue? Marble? Slate?), try instead, "Her eyes sparkled like sapphires in the dark."
<br>
To be evocative, descriptive writing has to unite the concrete image with phrasing that evokes the impression the writer wants the reader to have. 
Consider "her eyes shone like sapphires, warming my night" versus "the woman's eyes had a light like sapphires, bright and hard." Each phrase uses the same concrete image, 
then employs evocative language to create different impressions.<br>
To be plausible, the descriptive writer has to constrain the concrete, evocative image to suit the reader's knowledge and attention span. 
"Her eyes were brighter than the sapphires in the armrests of the Tipu Sultan's golden throne, yet sharper than the tulwars of his cruelest executioners" 
will have the reader checking their phone halfway through. "Her eyes were sapphires, bright and hard" creates the same effect in a fraction of the reading time. 
As always in the craft of writing: when in doubt, write less.
